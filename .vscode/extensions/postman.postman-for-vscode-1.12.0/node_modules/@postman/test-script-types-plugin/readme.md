# Postman Global Types

A TypeScript plugin that provides type definitions for Postman's environment, including collection, sandbox, and test script types.

## Overview

This plugin enhances the test script development experience in IDEs by providing global type definitions for:

- Postman Collection types
- Chai assertion library types
- Pre-request script types
- Post-request script types

## Features

- Automatic type injection based on script context
- Support for pre-request and post-request script environments
- Configurable identifiers for different script types
- Seamless integration with TypeScript language server

## Configuration

The plugin accepts the following configuration options:

```typescript
{
  preTestIdentifier: "pre-test",    // Identifier for pre-request scripts
  postTestIdentifier: "post-test",  // Identifier for post-request scripts
  tempFileIdentifier: "pm-temp"     // Identifier for temporary files
}
```

## Usage

The plugin is designed to work with TypeScript's language server. It automatically injects the appropriate type definitions based on the context of your script:
